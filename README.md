Code examples from http://www.vogella.com
=========================================

This project is **a collection of small and focused code example** - each covering a single and well defined area of development in the Java ecosystem. 
Each sub-topic is placed in a specific folder, so that you easily decide which part of the examples you want to import into your favorite IDE.
Different examples use different build systems.

Working with the IDE
====================
As this repository contains a larger number of modules and projects with different scopes you most likely do not want to import all of them.
Simply import that particular module or folder in either Eclipse or IntelliJ.
